LIRI: Language Interpretation & Recognition Interface.

This application was created with the intention of translating the User's input into questions that can be asked of internet databases via API calls.

The useage is limited to queries for:
Movies, by name only.
Spotify Songs, By name only.
Tweets, last 5 tweets from the user only.
And a demonstration of diverse functionality by calling Spotify information from a .txt document.

The user can find a log with all of the results from their queries in the attached log.txt file for future reference or print-out.
